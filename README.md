# JavaWebCommunication
A java project done for class. Creates a WebServer object and a WebBrowser object to search for and GET index.html

This was orginally an assignment in my Intermediate Java course and i actually enjoyed the challenge, so i decided to add it into this for keeping. it probably wont ever use this again practically, but it is nice to know that i could make something semi-realistic.
